We're nearly approaching regular expressions, but first let's define...

## The Regular Operations

Let $L$ and $M$ be languages over the same alphabet $\Sigma$.
The regular operations are:
* **Union**
    
    $L\cup M := \left\{w | w \in L \text{ or } w \in M\right\}$

* **Concatenation**

    $LM := \left\{uv | u \in L \text{ and } v \in M\right\}$

* **Kleene star**

    $L^\ast := \left\{w_1\dots w_n\ | n \geq 0 \text{ and } w_i \in L\right\}$

    It may also be defined as an infinite union of concatenations of $L$:

    $$\bigcup_{n=0}^\infty L^n$$

### Theorem: Regular Languages are closed under Regular Operations

> Let $L$ and $M$ be regular languages ver $\Sigma$ &mdash; then:
> * $L \cup M$
> * $LM$
> * $L^\ast$
>
> are also regular languages.

The idea behind this proof is to:
1. Make finite automata $A, B$ which except $L$ and $M$ respectively.
2. Use this to construct a new finite automaton that accepts $L \cup M$, $LM$, $L^\ast$, $M^\ast$.
3. The result is an NFA that accepts the desired combination.
$\bar L = \Sigma^\ast \setminus L$
### More closure properties

* $\bar L = \Sigma^\ast \setminus L = \{w \in \Sigma^\ast\ |\ w \notin L\}$ 
* $L \cap N = \{w \in \Sigma^\ast\ |\ w \in L \text{ and } w \in N \}$
