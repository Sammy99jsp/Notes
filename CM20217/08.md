# Using the Pumping Lemma in Proofs

Here, we'll use *Proof by Contradiction* as well as the Pumping Lemma.

## Example Proof
> $L = \Big\{w \in \big\{0, 1\big\}\ \big|\ w \text{ h as an equal number of 0s and 1s} \Big\}$
1. Suppose that $L$ is regular. Then by the Pumping Lemma, there's an $n \lt 0$ such that all words with $\big|w\big| \geq n$ can be pumped.
2. Define a word in the form $0^n 1^n \in L$ (note that $2n \geq n$)

3. By the pumping lemma, $w$ can be divided into three pieces $w = xyz$ with:
    * $y \neq e$
    * $\big|xy\big| \leq n$
    * $xy^iz$ has an equal numbers $0$s and $1$s for all $i \geq 0$
    $$w = \rlap{$
        \overbrace{\phantom{\underbrace{00 \dots 00}_{x \text{ elements}} \ \underbrace{0 \dots 0}_{y \text{ elements}} \ \dots 0}}^{n \text{ elements}}
    $}
        \rlap{$\phantom{111111111111111111_1}\overbrace{\phantom{111 \dots 11_1}}^{n \text{ elements}}$}
    \underbrace{00 \dots 00}_{x \text{ elements}} \ \underbrace{0 \dots 0}_{y \text{ elements}} \underbrace{\dots 0 \ \ 111 \dots 111}_{z \text{ elements}}$$
