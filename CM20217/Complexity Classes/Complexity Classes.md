## $P$ - Definition (Polynomial Time)
A Yes-No problem belongs to complexity class $P$ if there exists a [[Turing Machines|Turing machine]] that decides it of complexity $O(n^d)$ for some $d \geq 0$ (i.e. there is some polynomial power that the problem is $O(\dots)$ of).

We can use these to categorise algorithms (such as those that )
