If we compare context-free languages to regular languages, we note that whilst a regular language can be represented by a finite automaton, a context-free language can be represented as a context-free grammar. And, like how a finite automaton has a finite number of states, a context-free grammar has finite *variables*.

As there are finite variables, that means we should be able to "pump" variables...
