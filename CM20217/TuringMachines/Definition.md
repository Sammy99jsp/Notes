A Turing machine is made of:
- Head $\approx$ the "brain", or control unit (with a state $q$).
- Tape $\approx$ an infinite memory for storing calculations, made of individual cells:

Depending on the current state of the head $q$, and what's written on the cell it's looking at, the head will do one of three things:
1. Change what's written in the current cell;
2. Move left;
3. Move right;
