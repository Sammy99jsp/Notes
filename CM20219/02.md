## Camera Imaging
### Apertures
To get coherent non-blurry images, we'll need to somehow restrict the light coming into the sensor (otherwise multiple rays from different places will contribute to the same pixel).

For this, we use **apertures** which are essentially walls with gaps in them (usually in the mm range).

Even then, we can't just keep making the aperture smaller as we'll collect less light and appear (meaning longer exposure times), and we can still get blurry images as the rays of light may diffract through the gap.

### Thin Lens Camera
The lens will focus the light to a focal point, in an attempt to reduce the spreading of rays ending in blurry images. 

## Sensors
A **sensor array** is a discrete sampling of the continuous image that is projected onto an **image sensor**.

An image sensor converts this continuous light into pixel information.
