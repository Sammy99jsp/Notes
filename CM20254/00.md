# What?

## But what is an algorithm?
> Algorithm (n.) - A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

Some concepts covered in this unit:
| Keyword | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Specification** | What problem is the algorithm designed to solve |
| | How dows it work? |
| **Correctness** | Does it always output a correct solution all the time? |
| **Complexity** | How efficient is it? |

## What are data structures?
> Data structure (n.) A collection of data values along with operations that can be applied to them.

For example an array of integers with length $n$, where there is an an integer $a[i]$ for every index $i \in [0, n)$.

## Example: Santa's Missing Sock
Santa has mistakenly packaged his sock within one of $P$ *identical* presents.

How should we solve this?

| Method | Correct? | Complexity? |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Pick one, hope for the best. | $\dfrac{1}{P}$  chance of being correct. | $1$ (Constant) |
| Pick one up, check, then repackage and put back (don't separate from the rest).| Eventually, with the limit $t \rightarrow \infty$ | some probability stuff |
| Weigh 2 presents against each other, if one is heavier pick that one. | Yes. | $\dfrac{P}{2}$ |
| Group presents in half, weigh the groups, pick the heaviest, then repeat for the heaviest group. | Yes. | $\log_{2}P$|

# Why this unit?

1. To help you write better algorithms &mdash; We shall...
    * Explore common data structures and where they prop up.
    * Explore specific algorithms and general strategies.
    * Discuss performance and the design of algorithms.

2. To train you in formal reasoning
    * Important notations; formal ways of measuring complexity.
    * Reasoning about the correctness of iterative algorithms with loop invariance.

3. To make you a better computer scientist!
