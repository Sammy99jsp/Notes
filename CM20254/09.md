### Open Addressing, in detail
**Probing** is the process of searching for an empty space in a hash table when collisions arise.

This involves a **probe sequence**:
$$h(k, 0), h(k, 1),\ \dots, h(k, \underset{\mathclap{i\text{-th attempt at finding empty bucket}}}{i})$$
We've extended our hash function to to into account how many attempts we've taken to find an empty bucket.

Notice here the fact that our loading factor $\alpha$ must be $\lt 1$ so that we don't run out of space.

*Linear probing* does this by just checking the next bucket to see if it is empty:
$$h(k, i) := \left(h(k) + i\right) \bmod M$$
#### Operations under Open Addressing
* $\text{put}(k, v)$:
	1. Compute $h(k)$.
	2. Using the probe sequence $h(k, i)$, search for a free slot in the array.
	3. Add $(k, v)$ in the free slot.
* $\text{get}(k)$ and $\text{contains}(k)$:
	1. Compute $h(k)$.
	2. Using the probe sequence, search and return for an entry with $k$. If we don't encounter $k$ before an empty bucket, return nothing.
* $\text{delete}(k)$L:
	1. Compute $h(k)$.
	2. Remove $(k, v)$, then reorganise the rest of the entries in the probe sequence (to prevent the entries after from being abandoned).
#### Complexity of $\text{put}(k)$
Let's assume our has function $h(k)$ uniformly spreads hashes over our array; and that we have load factor $\alpha$.

We can model the number of probe steps (probe length) as a probability tree (whether a bucket is empty is a probability $\alpha$ -- the loading factor).

```tikz
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.3]
  \node {$h(k, 0)$}
    child {
	    node [left] {$h(k, 1)$}
	    child {node {$h(k, 2)$}
	      child {
		      node {$\dots$}
		      child {
			      node {$h(k, i)$}
			      child {
				      node {$i + 1$ steps}
			      }
			      edge from parent
				    node[left] {$\alpha$}
		      }
		      child {
			      node {$\dots$}
			      edge from parent
				    node[right] {$(1- \alpha)$}
		      }
		      edge from parent
			    node[left] {$\alpha$}
		    }
	      child {
		      node {3 steps}
		      edge from parent
			    node[right] {$(\alpha - 1)$}
	      }
	      edge from parent
			    node[left] {$\alpha$}
	    }
	    child {node {2 steps}
		  edge from parent
			    node[right] {$(1- \alpha)$}
	    }
	    edge from parent
		    node[left] {$\alpha$}
	}
    child {node {1 step}
      edge from parent
		    node[right] {$(1- \alpha)$}
    };
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
We can calculate the expected probe length $L$, using the recursive formula:
$$L =1 + \alpha L$$
We can rearrange for $L$:
$$L = \frac{1}{1 - \alpha}$$
This means that the complexity of $\text{put}(k, v)$ is:
$$\Theta\left(1 + \frac{1}{1-\alpha}\right)$$

(Assuming $\alpha \lt 1$ is always true)
#### Complexity of other operations
This process is more complex due to the chance of not finding a key in the hash map. But, it ends up being:
$$\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\log\frac{1}{1-\alpha} + \frac{1}{\alpha}\right)$$

Notice, all the operations have $\Theta(1)$ average-case complexity (as $\alpha$ is a constant)!
