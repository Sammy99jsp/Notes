## What is a graph?
A *directed* graph is defined as an object consisting of:
* A set of vertices (or nodes) - $V$ 
* A set of edges $E$
* a function $s: E \rightarrow V$ telling us the source of each edge
* a function $t: E \rightarrow V$ telling us the target of each edge

Normally, graphs don't have loops - i.e. $s(e) \neq t(e)$.
