Exploring a tree is known as *traversal*.
For binary trees, there are a few approaches:
* **Preorder traversal**: Depth-first search approach.
* **Postorder traversal**: Traverse sub-trees, then the root.
* **Inorder traversal**: Traverse left sub-tree, then root, then right sub-tree.
* **Level-order traversal**: Bread-first search approach.
