$\lambda$-calculus is a theory of functions, proposed by Alonzo Church in the '30s. It can be thought of as the mathematical foundation of functional programming.

$\lambda$-calculus is a formal system, where:
- every term denotes a function
- any term (function) can be applied to any other term, so functions are inherently higher-order.

The syntax/semantics are so small, it's really surprising that it is Turing-complete!
