### But what is a style?
* Programming styles are approaches or philosophies about how languages are designed to make writing correct programs easier.
* In general, styles facilitate a structure to make collaboration easier: they allow programmers to think in bigger, more abstract concepts (such as classes, functions, modules, etc) — to reduce the complexity for the programmer. *To make programmers make fewer mistakes.*
* With perfect programmers, styles are not necessary — but we're human beings.
## Examples
- Object-orientated (objects and classes).
- Procedural (about functions calling other functions).
- Functional-style (higher-order functions: functions are values too!)
- Declarative (what you *want*, not *how*).
- No style (like raw binary, or Assembly).
