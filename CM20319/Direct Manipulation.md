WIMP enables an interaction style known as *direct manipulation*, which features:
- Continuous representation of the object of interest (e.g. dragging an app to move it — it always stays on screen),
- Physical actions over complex text-based command syntax — which enables rapid learning.
- Reversible, incremental actions through continuous feedback (e.g. "Are you sure you want to delete this file?")
