Most UIs are based off the Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer (WIMP) paradigm, which enables [[Direct Manipulation]].
### Windows
Windows are outputs that allow users to visually access content that can be larger than the content of the screen.
### Icons
These provide visual access to discrete programs and documents, and can map actions to a pointer device.
### Menus, Dialogues, and Forms
- Menus can act as a substitute for a command-line syntax: instead of a syntax, they provide pointing structures which perform the same input, with more visual ques to the user.
- Forms and dialogues are collections of widgets, which solicit user input typically with constraints (e.g. "email-only", sliders, radio buttons).
