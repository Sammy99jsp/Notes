Most UIs are based off the Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer (WIMP) paradigm.
### Windows
Windows are outputs that allow users to visually access content that can be larger than the content of the screen.
### Icons
These provide visual access to discrete programs and documents, and can map actions to a pointer device.
### Menus, Dialogues, and Forms
- Menus can act as a substitute for a command-line syntax: instead of a syntax, they provide pointing structures which perform the same input, with more visual ques to the user.
- Forms and dialogues are collections of widgets, which solicit user input typically with constraints (e.g. "email-only", sliders, radio buttons).
## Direct Manipulation
WIMP enables an interaction style known as *direct manipulation*, which features:
- Continuous representation of the object of interest (e.g. dragging an app to move it — it always stays on screen),
- Physical actions over complex text-based command syntax — which enables rapid learning.
- Reversible, incremental actions through continuous feedback (e.g. "Are you sure you want to delete this file?")
