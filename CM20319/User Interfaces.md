User Interfaces (UIs) are consisted of three things:
- a computer,
- an interface,
- a human.
Computers are thought of entirely *deterministic*, they produce *outputs* from inputs according to some *algorithm/function* — any perceived unpredictability in an output is actually determined by the inputs.
## Inputs
Inputs are any kind of data a user provides.
This includes:
- *Low-level inputs* — mouse position, keypress/unpress, mouse button up/down.
- *Higher-level inputs* — inputs the UI processes itself; derived from low-level inputs.
Inputs can be thought of controls through which the user expresses input.
### Explicit Inputs
Input elements that are shown to the user, such as buttons, text boxes, check-boxes, etc.
### Implicit Inputs
Inputs that are not explicitly manipulated by the user themselves, such as:
- Search history,
- Accelerometer/Pedometer
- Settings (set elsewhere)
Sometimes, implicit inputs have defaults determined by the designers to fit what they believe the user expects.
## Task Analysis
The process of asking questions such as:
- Given a human task that a computer is designed to support:
	- What functions are required to support this task?
	- What are the steps that could be turned into functions?
- What input is needed for these functions, and which are user-driven?
	- Explicit/Implicit?
- How much do the users need to know about the functions:
	- Which input is required?
	- Comprehending the output.
