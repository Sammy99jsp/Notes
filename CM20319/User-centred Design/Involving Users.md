### Gathering Requirements
Ideally, you should focus on people's goals and system usability: stakeholders rarely articulate requirements effectively, so some coaxing is necessary:
1. Explore the problem space;
2. Investigate who the users are and their perspectives;
3. Investigate user activities to see what can be improved;
4. Try out ideas with potential users and iterate.

### Users in the Design Team
Categories of users in the design team include:
- **Full-time** — constant input, danger of them taking a developer perspective, large commitment.
- **Part-time** — patchy input, can be stressful.
- **Short-term** — inconsistent across the project's lifetime.
- **Long-term** — consistent, but you can lose touch with them.

### Feedback from Users not Directly Involved
- Online Feedback Exchange (OFE) systems
- Crowdsourcing design ideas.
- Citizen science (scientific research with public involvement).

### User Groups
- These are 'silos' of users that are likely to be interested and interact with the system.
- It can be hard to classify users in this way, since some systems are built "for everyone". Sometimes, you may not anticipate the intended audience (see SMS example).
