User-centred design (UCD) is an iterative design methodology and philosphy that puts the *user at the centre of all design decisions*, with the goal being to optimise a user's experience of the system.
## The Three Principles of User-Centred Design
1. True **clarity** of user and task feedback.
2. **Integration** of user feedback **iterative-ly**.
3. **Active involvement** of users throughout the design process (as early as possible).
### The User's Perspective
Consider the user's:
- Abilities, real needs, and 'wants';
- Goals, motivations, and triggers;
- Context of use;
- Tasks, activities and behaviours;
- Obstacles and limitations.
